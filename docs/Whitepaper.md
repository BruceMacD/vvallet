**Abstract.** Through ownership of a secret key that allows adding transactions to a blockchain an owner can demonstrate that they control many separate accounts. This proof of ownership can be done in a trust-less decentralized manner through the process of "bidirectional linking". First a key holder registers their ownership of that keypair on chain through creating an alias. Next, an account holder adds a public message to their distributed accounts that asserts their vvallet.me alias. The account holder then uses their private key to sign a transaction which contains a link to this vvallet.me assertion and adds it on chain. Through adding both of these identity assertions the account holder has created a proven link between their identities.

# 1. Introduction

As user's web presence grows and they use more separate online services their digital identity grows increasingly distributed. Someone may have the username 'Alice1234' on Twitter while their blog can be found at  'my-inner-thoughts.com'. How can the owner of both of these separate online entities prove that they are in-fact in control of both?

This paper proposes a process of bidirectional linking which allows an account holder to prove they are in pocession of two completely separate online accounts using their cryptocurrency wallet. By using a cryptocurrency wallet the user can create a link between their centralized “Web2” and decentralized “Web3” identities. This simplifies the transition from centralized web applications to decentealized applications. It also positions vvallet.me as a trusted authority on decentralized identity that users can rely on as an identity source for any decentralized application. It also means vvallet.me is a convinient mechanism to prove components of their identity across different applications. 

## TODO: make this its own section on application storage and interaction

The decentralized and trust-less storage mechanism of the vvallet.me identity verification process is a blockchain. In order to add a transaction onto a blockchain a user must sign a transaction to prove they have the authorization to make the change on-chain. The keypair that a user holds to show authorization is apmost always stored in a cryptocurrency wallet. The vvallet.me application relies on the convinient cryptocurency wallet user interface to make keypir management easy for users.

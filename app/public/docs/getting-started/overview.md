As your web presence grows and you use more separate online services your digital identity grows increasingly distributed. You may have the username `Alice1234` on Twitter while your blog can be found at `funny-cats.com`. How can you prove both of these separate online profiles are in-fact controlled by you?

VVallet.me uses a process of bidirectional linking which allows you to prove you are in possession of two completely separate online accounts using your Solana cryptocurrency wallet. VVallet.me creates a link between your centralized "Web2" and decentralized "Web3" identities. This simplifies the transition from centralized web applications to decentralized applications. It also positions vvallet.me as a trusted authority on decentralized identity that you can rely on as an identity source for any decentralized application. The goal of vvallet.me is to be a convenient mechanism to prove ownership of digital identity across different applications.

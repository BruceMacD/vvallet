VVallet.me is a directory that maps social media identities to a Solana cryptocurrency wallet. Through ownership of a secret key (stored in a Solana crypto wallet) that allows adding transactions to the Solana blockchain an owner can demonstrate that they control many separate accounts. This proof of ownership can be done in a trust-less decentralized manner through the process of "bidirectional linking". First a wallet owner registers their address on-chain through creating an alias. Next, an account holder adds a public message to one of their distributed accounts that asserts their vvallet.me alias. The account holder then uses their wallet to add a link assertion and on-chain. Through creating both of these identity assertions the account holder has created a proven link between their Solana wallet alias and their social media identity.

The decentralized and trust-less storage mechanism of the vvallet.me identity verification process is the Solana blockchain. In order to add a transaction onto the blockchain a user must sign a transaction to prove they have the authorization to make the change on-chain. The keypair that a user holds to show authorization is (almost always) stored in a cryptocurrency wallet. The vvallet.me application relies on the convenience of a cryptocurrency wallet as a user interface to make key pair management easy for users.

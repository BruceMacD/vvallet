Bidirectional proof of ownership allows creating a link between two separate accounts in a trustless way by publicly showing that the owner has access to secrets that only the holder of both accounts would have access to. This process is bidirectional in the fact that the proof of ownership across the separate platforms points to corresponding proof on the other account. This form of proof is trustless because the assertion of account ownership on both accounts can be verified to be true by any party that wishes to do so. All the proof needed for verification is publically visible and decentralized.

This process is more easily understandable with a real world example. Picture a scenario where someone needed to prove that the car parked outside their house belonged to them while they weren't physically present. They could leave a note behind the windshield of their car claiming ownership of the home, but there would be no way to tell if that home actually belonged to them. The same problem of one-way proof would also exist if the owner left a note claiming ownership of some car behind a window in their house. The only way for this person to prove they own both the car and the house without being physically present would be to put a note behind the windshield of the car that indicated which house belonged to them, with a corresponding note behind the window of their home verifying that their car is the one in question.

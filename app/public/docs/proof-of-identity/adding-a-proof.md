Once a keypair is registered with an alias on vvallet.me you may now begin linking to this alias across your distributed online identities.

Linking a social media identity involves two steps:

1. Making a public post as proof.

To show that you own a social media profile you must make a public post that contains a link to your vvallet.me alias.

2. Adding that proof on-chain.

With a publically accessible proof post you can show you are also in possession of the cryptocurrency wallet by using vvallet.me to sign a transaction which is added on-chain if the signature is valid.

Specific details for adding a proof on different social networks can be found while adding a proof through the vvallet.me portal.

VVallet.me currently supports automatic verification on the following types of proof of ownership:

- Domain Name
- Ethereum Name Service
- Mastodon
- Twitter
- Reddit

title: 'Registering an Alias'
section: 3.0

The first step of using vvallet.me is to register ownership of a keypair. This is done by submitting a request to register a new vvallet.me alias (you will automatically be directed to do this when connecting a new Solana wallet to vvallet.me). This alias allows for a keypair to have a persistent identity which can be used across any application that connects to a cryptocurrency wallet. The vvallet.me alias is unique and does not expire until it is released by the owner.
